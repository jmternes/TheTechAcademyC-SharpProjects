# The Tech Academy C# Projects

Here are some basic skills acquired and projects I made using C# and .NET Framework!

## Skills:
Throughout the C# / .NET Course of the [Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com)'s Software Developer Boot Camp, I acquired a strong foundation of skills and knowledge to gain confidence and proficiency in the basics of C# and the .NET Framework. 

## Projects:
[Car Insurance](https://github.com/jmternes/CarInsurance)

This is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input regarding policy information and calculates a mock quote based on business logic. There's also an admin page that lets staff view all quotes that have been issued.

[Blackjack Game](https://github.com/jmternes/TheTechAcademyC-SharpProjects/tree/main/Blackjack)

This console app is a working game of [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). It takes in user input for "bets" and keeps track of the user's "bank", following real-world rules of the popular casino game.

[MVC App Live Project](https://github.com/jmternes/C-Sharp-Live-Project)

I had the opportunity to work within a legacy codebase for a Content Management System for a local theatre in Portland, Oregon. My work on the project was done over a 2-week sprint period, complete with Scrum framework attributes such as a sprint planning meeting, daily standups, and code retrospectives.
